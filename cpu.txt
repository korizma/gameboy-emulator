CPU workflow:

    * 8 registers
        A, F
        B, C
        D, E
        H, L
        - each 8bit, being 16bit when combined
    * PC register
    * SP register

    * Register AF also known as Accumulator & Flags
        - A register is AC 
        - F is for flags, where the following bit is for the following flags
            * bit 7: Zero Flags
            * bit 6: Subtraction flag (BCD)
            * bit 5: Half Carry flag (BCD)
            * bit 4: Carry flag 

            * 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
            * Z N H C 0 0 0 0

Class CPU:
    * singleton class
    * storages the registers
    * handles PC and SP
    * Methods:
        - write/read registers
        - change PC/SP
        - execute instruction

Instructions:
    * contains logic for all instruction
    * probably the most redudant
    * still don't have that much information about the system so its empty for now
        



Functions to implement:
    bool flag(_flag_)
        - returns state of flag
    
    void setFlag(_flag_, _val_)
        - sets the flag to value
    
    void incSP()
        - increases the stack pointer
